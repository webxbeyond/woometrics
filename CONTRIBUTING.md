## Development Process

### Setting Up Development Environment

# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/webxbeyond/woometrics.git
cd woometrics

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your WooCommerce store credentials
# Start development server

```

### Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ app.js              # Main application entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ config/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ stores.config.js # Store configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ woocommerce-client.js  # WooCommerce API client
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ metrics-collector.js   # Prometheus metrics collector
â””â”€â”€ utils/
    â””â”€â”€ logger.js       # Winston logger configuration
```

### Coding Standards

* Use ES6+ features and ES Modules
* Follow the existing code style
* Add JSDoc comments for public methods
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Keep functions small and focused
* Add error handling for all async operations

### Adding New Metrics

When adding new metrics, follow this pattern:

1. Define the metric in `MetricsCollector` constructor
2. Add collection logic in appropriate collect method
3. Update README documentation
4. Add tests for the new metric

Example:
```javascript
// In constructor
this.newMetric = new client.Gauge({
    name: 'woocommerce_new_metric',
    help: 'Description of what this measures',
    labelNames: ['store_id', 'store_name', 'additional_label'],
    registers: [this.register]
});

// In collection method
this.newMetric.set(
    { store_id: storeId, store_name: storeName, additional_label: value },
    metricValue
);
```

### Testing

* Write unit tests for new features
* Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
* Add integration tests for new API endpoints
* Test with multiple WooCommerce store configurations

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

### Adding New Store Support

When adding support for new e-commerce platforms:

1. Create a new client in `src/services/`
2. Implement the same interface as `WooCommerceClient`
3. Update store configuration to support the new platform
4. Add platform-specific metrics if needed
5. Update documentation

## Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Examples:
```
Add support for product variation metrics

Closes #123

- Add new metrics for product variations
- Update tests for variation tracking
- Add documentation for new metrics
```
